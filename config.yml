        Title: Hello! I'm glad you're here :D
        Content: Welcome to my blog, where you can find lots of front-end developing knowledge and you can see how my programming journey goes! I try to describe in detail my struggles with various programming problems. As I put up this blog, I am comfortable with .html, .css, .md, git and creating a static page generator like Hugo. My native language is Polish, so I apologize for any language mistakes. If you're looking for something on a specific topic, take a look at the tags section.
